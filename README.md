# Backend Test

Develop a functionality allowing administrators to customize:

- the User profile
- the User signup form
- an Event Registration form

In order to focus on the important parts, no need to develop a UI. The code will be run through the tests, and possibly through the console. We want to focus on models, possibly service classes with clean interfaces, but not controllers/views.

Use cases that the service must support:

- Admin manages the global User custom attributes
- Admin manages a specific Event’s custom attributes
- Admin makes a custom attribute optional/required on the User profile
- Admin makes a custom attribute optional/required on the User signup form
- Admin makes a custom attribute optional/required on a specific Event Registration form
- User fills in a custom attribute on his profile
- User fills in a custom attribute on the signup form
- User fills in a custom attribute on an Event Registration form
- User reads his custom attributes on his profile
- Admin reads an Event registration’s custom attributes

Custom attributes types supported:

- Text
- Boolean
